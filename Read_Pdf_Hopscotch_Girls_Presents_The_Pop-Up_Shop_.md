Overview
Join Mia Madison, CEO, in the latest installment of the Hopscotch Girls series, as she continues to conquer the (kid) business world. Mia&#039;s consulting business is flourishing, and she&#039;s lending her expertise to her classmates&#039; ventures. But that&#039;s not all â€“ Mia&#039;s juggling auditions for the school musical alongside her best friend, Zari. Mia will have to hire an assistant to help her manage everything. Easier said than done.
 
 Mia has successfully helped three classmates get their businesses up and running using her tried and true business strategies. In book two, Mia extends her consulting expertise to Aubrey, a fellow student, as they collaborate on opening a pop-up shop to showcase Aubrey&#039;s upcycled treasures. At the same time, sheâ€™s nervously preparing to join Zari in auditions for the school musical, Annie. As Mia&#039;s world gets busier, she faces an important task: She needs to hire an assistant to keep her consulting business running smoothly.
 Â 
 Join Mia as she navigates the challenging but rewarding path of balancing her business, hiring an assistant, and ensuring there&#039;s still time for fun and friendship. Mia&#039;s story is a delightful blend of entrepreneurship, friendship, and the pursuit of one&#039;s passions. This is the second book in the Hopscotch Girls series and features 40 fun illustrations and doodles throughout!
