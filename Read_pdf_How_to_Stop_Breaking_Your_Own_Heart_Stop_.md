â€˜Megganâ€™s words have the power to make you feel seen, understood, and less alone. This book is the reminder you need that you are worthy of self-love and acceptance.â€™
 Jay Shetty, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Think Like A Monk and host of the On Purpose podcast
 
 Life can be a lot. How are you supposed to maintain healthy relationships, build a career, keep up with the constant life admin, and prioritize your well-being? Itâ€™s so easy to get distracted and lose sight of your path, until one day you realize youâ€™re completely lost, trapped in a cycle of self-sabotage and people pleasing.
 
 You are not alone.
 
 Following her own personal experience of dealing with anxiety and depression, Meggan Roxanne has united a community of 30 million people by sharing ways to navigate everyday struggles. Now sheâ€™s using the lessons sheâ€™s learned along the way to help you to:
 
 Â· overcome negative thought patterns
 Â· move away from perfectionism and break free from expectations
 Â· say â€˜noâ€™ to toxic people and situations and set boundaries
 Â· stop keeping yourself small and step into your power
 Â· build a life where self-love is non-negotiable.
