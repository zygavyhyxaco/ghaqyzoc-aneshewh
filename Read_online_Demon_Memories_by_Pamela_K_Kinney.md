No one expected the apocalypse in the almost idyllic small town of Moon Ridge, nestled in the mountains of Virginia. Harper Doyle feels different. She has more than her fair share of problems than any normal teenager; an absent father her mother doesn&amp;#039;t talk about, and her friends died in a fire a year ago. There&amp;#039;s no boyfriend in sight, not even the cute former childhood friend, Jake Hewitt, who&amp;#039;s too busy hanging with the bratty son of the richest man in Moon Ridge. It gets worse when Harper discovers she&amp;#039;s possessed by a demon. Cresil is a demon with a problem. She wants to be shed of Harper but finds she can&amp;#039;t. An exorcism by Jake&amp;#039;s psychic mother doesn&amp;#039;t help. Even worse, Cresil learns that she was never the demon summoned, but was sent by magic to take that demon&amp;#039;s place. Baal has plans that include leading Lucifer&amp;#039;s demonic army into the mortal realm to jump start the apocalypse and battle Heaven. He just needs a possessed mortal to keep the portal between Earth and Hell open. Except there&amp;#039;s a prophesy-that includes Cresil, Harper, and Jake-to stop the end of the world. Uses Deaja Vu (traditional) font style
