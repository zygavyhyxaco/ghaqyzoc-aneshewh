Overview
&quot;[Thayne] engages the readerâ€™s heart and emotions, inspiring hope and the belief that miracles are possible.&quot; â€”Debbie Macomber, #1 New York Times bestselling author
 
 Come home to Shelter Springs this Christmas, where hearts are warm and hopes are brightâ€¦
 
 Growing up at the Shelter Inn hotel, Natalie Shepherd envied guests who could come and go as they pleased. So when it was time to finally leave for college and put the lush green mountains around Shelter Springsâ€”along with the cloud of loss that seemed to follow her familyâ€”behind her, she swore sheâ€™d never come back. But now her sister McKenna needs a favor. On pregnancy bed rest at doctorâ€™s orders, McKenna needs a helping hand with her two young daughters and someone to take over the inn during the hectic holiday season, and Nat canâ€™t refuse. And just when things canâ€™t get worse, she runs into her late brotherâ€™s best friend, Griffin Taylorâ€¦
 
 Griff has mixed feelings about Natalieâ€™s return. Sheâ€™s just as beautiful and full of life as he remembered, but thereâ€™s a secret heâ€™s carried for years about her brotherâ€”and the guilt is eating away at him. Still, Christmas in this small town is filled with treasured traditions and new adventures that hold the promise of something sweet and lasting. From matchmaking seniors to rambunctious nieces, it seems everyone is hoping Nat and Griff will put loss behind them and find a happy new beginningâ€¦
 
 Don&#039;t miss the enchanting holiday tale, THE DECEMBER MARKET by RaeAnne Thayne, a story of second chances, family, and unexpected love, set in the charming town of Shelter Springs, where the spirit of Christmas brings two reluctant hearts together.
