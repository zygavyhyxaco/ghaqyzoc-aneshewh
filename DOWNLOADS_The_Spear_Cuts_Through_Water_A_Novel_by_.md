Overview
Two warriors shepherd an ancient god across a broken land to end the tyrannical reign of a royal family in this new epic fantasy from the author of The Vanished Birds.

 ‚ÄúA beguiling fantasy not to be missed.‚Äù‚ÄîEvelyn Skye, New York Times bestselling author of The Crown‚Äôs Game

 ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022‚ÄîTordotcom, BookPage, LitHub

 The people suffer under the centuries-long rule of the Moon Throne. The royal family‚Äîthe despotic emperor and his monstrous sons, the Three Terrors‚Äîhold the countryside in their choking grip. They bleed the land and oppress the citizens with the frightful powers they inherited from the god locked under their palace.

 But that god cannot be contained forever.

 With the aid of Jun, a guard broken by his guilt-stricken past, and Keema, an outcast fighting for his future, the god escapes from her royal captivity and flees from her own children, the triplet Terrors who would drag her back to her unholy prison. And so it is that she embarks with her young companions on a five-day pilgrimage in search of freedom‚Äîand a way to end the Moon Throne forever. The journey ahead will be more dangerous than any of them could have imagined.

 Both a sweeping adventure story and an intimate exploration of identity, legacy, and belonging, The Spear Cuts Through Water is an ambitious and profound saga that will transport and transform you‚Äîand is like nothing you‚Äôve ever read before.
